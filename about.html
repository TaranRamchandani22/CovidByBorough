  <h4>Sketch Explanations</h4>

Taran's sketches(right): My Sketches show New York as a state and also NYC. The Macro drawing has circles with varying shape and opacity to show
the different rates of infection, and the background color is a second data column to compare to, such as vaccination rate. However, this layering is difficult, so we may opt for a more achievable approach of toggling views with buttons.
The Micro one shows similar data by zip code in NYC, a visualization close to what we decided for our final design.

  <h3>Final Design</h3>
  Because our prototypes were fairly similar, it was easy to settle on a unified approach for the website. Our website will examine covid cases per capita, and vaccinations per capita. On the macro level, we will represent the average covid cases and vaccinations for each borough. We will represent this data by displaying a map of NYC where each borough is a certain color based on how many covid cases there are. On the micro level, we will create two pages for each of the five boroughs. For each borough one page will be a zoomed in map of said borough that is colored in based on the covid cases for each neighborhood. The second page for each borough will be a zoomed in map of said borough that is colored in based on the vaccination rate for each neighborhood. For each page in our website, we might include a data table alongside the maps. We decided to take this approach, because it seemed achievable to make, and it seemed like it would be understandable to users. We opted for a more achievable approach of toggling views with buttons, so rather than go with Taran's plan, we decided to use Amelia's plan. The layering of circle graphics, and color graphics hown in Taran's design, would be difficult to code, and therfore not achievable.


  <h3>Vocabulary needed</h3>
  Per Capita= for each person

  <h3>Work Distribution</h3>
Our group will work together on the macro "walking skeleton". For the micro "walking skeleton" Amelia will complete the vacination rate skeleton, and Taran will complete the covid cases skeleton.
