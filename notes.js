----NOTES----
--walking skeleton--
a walking skeleton is to build the internal architecture
  -your goal is to save the infographic for later,
    -and make sure the other parts of your website work
--folder--
  -check out fs.demo.js to figure out how to do generateJSON.js
source folder
  -holds all of your images, and blank templates

--To-Do--
-come up with a naming convention
  -use looping to do that
    -makes things easier
-use looping to come up with html files


--Pipeline notes--
NPM tools
  -npm test means run comand associated with command test,
    -it automates you running comand line scripts
      -you could auto-generate documentation
      -you could auto-check your code for missing ;, etc.
        -goes beyond the compiling process
      PROJECT
  -we have to, for our project, we have to delete old versions of micro pages
    -and then push new micro pages into build
      -NPM will do this for us
        -our build pipline will do this for us
      **look at pipline presentation


//mr. Gohde notes
//flat hiearchy in the build
      -each micro page generate sepreate file, or put script tag in html
      -in pre-build for the build pipline, generate files in build from images in src, then delete said imahges
